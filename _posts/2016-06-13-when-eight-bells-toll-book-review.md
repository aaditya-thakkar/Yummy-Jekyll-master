### [When Eight Bells Toll](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/149606.When_Eight_Bells_Toll)

-by Alistair Maclean
<br />

Thriller genre is something which is my cup of tea. Alistair MacLean is a magnificent storyteller, has wrote many thrillers in 20th century and the one I read first of his is, “When Eight bells toll”, thrill and suspense in the title itself.<br />


## Plot and Characters

The whole story plot is set entirely at the sea. There are many cases of hijacking of ships and pirating of gold bullion off the western highlands of Scotland. Investigations are being made by British Secret Service. The story is starring a British secret-service agent, Peter Calvert, the main character of the story. He is assigned a task to investigate the matter by Rear-admiral Sir Arthur Arnford (mentioned as Uncle Arthur throughout the book). The whole operation is divided into 10 scenes starting from the Monday dusk to the Friday dawn.

The central character, Peter Calvert has got a great sense of humor. He is the brains and hands of the whole operation. Uncle Arthur's role is to fulfill the needs of Peter Calvert, whatever he requires – helicopters, men, etc. There are some side characters, whose roles are also very well sketched. Like, a rich Greek tycoon Sir Anthony Skouras and his female companion, former actress Charlotte Meiner, Peter's companion Hunslett, etc.<br />


## Story

The starting of the story is of kind which every thriller lover would want. It's very well written and creates a great suspense. Peter is in front of the Peacemaker Colt gun, which he would never like to be, as he knows very well how it shatter bones and flesh. People are trying to kill Peter Calvert, but why? Who? We even don't know who is on the other side of the Colt. There are so many questions juggling in the mind when you complete the first page of the book.

But as the story goes on, many things get more and more clear. Peter Calvert plans to board and search, the Natesville on the first night of his operation. He seems to be liking playing with his life in any circumstances, and he plays his game very well. He also stabs his opponents in their backs bloodthirstily. His attitude is shown to be who-cares-so-long-as-I-don't-get-killed. He never feels any sort of compunction over the lives that he takes. He likes snuffing around criminal's lives.<br />


## Complements

The whole story goes like a roller coaster ride and you enjoy each and every part of it. It's a fast reading, full of suspense and thrillers and a great writing too. I can say that the story is able to put visualizations of the whole picture in your mind. Some quotes are very humorous and well written as well. My favorite ones are:

 >*"No matter how clever and strong and ruthless you were, sooner or later you would meet up with someone who was cleverer and stronger and more ruthless than yourself."*

 >*"and I had no doubt they had gone on being as still and watchful as ever, but they hadn’t been watchful enough and now they were only still"*

 <br />

## Complaints

It has too much technical descriptions which seems boring sometimes. For examples, the description of Peacemaker Colt, boat, its engine, batteries etc. Only experts of those field would understand that. But yeah, I strongly feel that peacemaker colt was the only thing which could bring interest towards the story in my mind.

One more thing I would say is that story seems bit dated. It takes time getting to the point of anything. It's a fast read, no doubt, but what I felt is, till the first three fifth part of the book, I was not totally clear about what/why is all these happening. Why the narrator is killing those enemies very ruthlessly! There is a lot of secretive messing about the boats done by Peter, but half the times I didn't get the purpose behind that, which got cleared in the later part of the book.

Also, there are some references to a wince-inducing attitude towards women, which is something that is very dated.<br />


## Conclusion

I would surely recommend this book, it's worth reading. It's well written (I would say well pictured), easy to understand language, too much suspense, excitement, light humor and thrill.
